# Sensors, card, services and API

Each tracked device gets five sensors under its own `<device> (Sextant)`
device, nested beneath its Bermuda device:

| Sensor | State |
|---|---|
| `sensor.<device>_sextant_location` | **the one to read**: the spot if it is in one, otherwise the room |
| `sensor.<device>_sextant_floor` | the elected floor |
| `sensor.<device>_sextant_room` | the elected room, with hysteresis and the stationary lock |
| `sensor.<device>_sextant_nearest_room` | the nearest room on that floor, instantaneous |
| `sensor.<device>_sextant_spot` | the spot inside the room, `unknown` when in none; attribute `room` |

`_sextant_location` is the whole answer in one entity, at the finest
resolution available: *David Bedside Table* when the watch is on the table,
*Master Bedroom* when it is somewhere else in the room. Its attributes say
which of the two you got and fill in the rest, so nothing needs a second
lookup:

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| `kind` | `spot` or `room` — the state alone cannot be told apart, *Couch* and *Office* both being names |
| `room` | always the room, whether the state is the spot or the room |
| `spot` | the spot, or `None` |
| `floor` | the elected floor |
| `area_id`, `floor_id` | the linked Home Assistant area and floor, or `None` where unlinked |
| `presence` | `here` (heard within `stale_after_secs`, 2 min), `quiet` (until `away_after_secs`, 15 min), `away` — on every one of the five sensors |
| `last_heard` | when the thing was last heard, ISO 8601 UTC; not recorded, since it moves every cycle |

When the state is a spot, `room` is the room that spot belongs to rather
than the separately elected room. The two disagree for a cycle or so while
a thing crosses a boundary, and a spot paired with a room it is not in is
worse than one that lags.

`_sextant_nearest_room` drops to `unknown` as soon as no proxy reports a
distance (about 30 s, Bermuda's timeout): the clean "who is home" signal.
`_sextant_room` and `_sextant_floor` hold their value through a grace
period (`position_timeout`, five minutes by default) so a brief gap does
not blink someone out of a room; after it the thing leaves the map and
all three read `unknown`. `sensor.sextant_position_accuracy` is the global
self-test result.

## People

Give things an owner on the Things page and each person gets three sensors
of the same shape — `sensor.<person>_sextant_person_location`, `_room` and
`_floor` — placed by whichever of their things speaks for them (`via`), and a
`device_tracker.<person>_sextant`.

While Sextant hears any of the person's things they are placed by BLE
(`source: ble`). Not heard for a couple of minutes, the last place they were
put stands (`source: held`): they have not left the house. Once Sextant has
lost them (`presence: away`) the first GPS tracker in their list that is
neither broken nor stale gives the zone (`source: gps`), or the state is
`away` with nothing usable (`source: none`). The list is set per person on
the Things page (People card) and lives in the layout as `person_trackers`;
a tracker that is unknown, unavailable, or has not reported within
`gps_stale_secs` (two hours by default) is passed over, and `gps_ignored`
names the ones that were and why.

| Attribute (location sensor) | Value |
|---|---|
| `source` | `ble`, `held`, `gps` or `none` |
| `presence` | as for things: the most present of the person's things |
| `via`, `considered` | the thing that placed them, and every thing that was in the running |
| `zone`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `gps_accuracy`, `tracker` | the GPS side, carried whichever source is speaking |
| `distance_m` | from Home Assistant's home location, when there are coordinates |
| `gps_ignored` | `[{entity, reason}, …]` |

`device_tracker.<person>_sextant` says the same in Home Assistant's own
currency: `home` while presence is `here` or `quiet` (source type
`bluetooth_le`), the GPS fix once it is `away` (source type `gps`, so the
state is the zone), `not_home` with nothing usable. Add it to the person
entity, the map card, or a zone automation.

[Recipes](recipes.md) has automations and cards built on all of this.

## Map card

```yaml
type: custom:sextant-map-card
floor: Ground Floor
entities:            # thing keys as in /api/sextant/cords; omit for every tracked thing
  - davids_phone
title: Downstairs    # optional
height: 360          # px
circles: false       # the solver's distance circles
trails: true
labels: true
subzones: true       # draw spots
follow: false        # switch floors with the first entity
```

The card draws with the panel's renderer and the same subscription, so it
shows exactly what Live shows. `image` (a URL) or `map_file` (the name of a
file in `config/sextant_maps/`) overrides the floor's plan.

## API

- `GET /api/sextant/cords`: one row per thing (`ent` is the thing key)
  with its position (`cords`), confidence, the radii the solver used and
  their fit residual, `floor` and the floor probabilities (`floors`), the
  room (`zone`), the raw room, the lock state and speed, the spot and the
  spot shares (`sub_zones`), the anchor proxy, the estimator and the
  fingerprint telemetry (`fp`).
- `sextant/subscribe` over the websocket pushes the same payload plus proxy
  health once per positioning cycle:

  ```js
  hass.connection.subscribeMessage(
    (event) => console.log(event.positions, event.offline_receivers),
    { type: "sextant/subscribe" },
  );
  ```
- Websocket commands, all request/response: `layout/get`, `layout/save`,
  `receivers`, `scanner_linking`, `beacon_links`, `adjust_zones`,
  `calibration/status`, `calibration/action`, `history/index`,
  `history/get`, `history/clear`, `kpi`, `kpi/baselines`,
  `kpi/baseline/save`, `kpi/baseline/delete`, `tuning/set`,
  `thing/tune`, `selftest`, `truth/mark`, `truth/list`,
  `truth/delete`, `truth/evaluate`, `truth/apply`, `proxy/info`, `advice`,
  `snapshots/list`, `snapshots/restore`, `thing/forget`,
  `person/trackers/set`, and under `bermuda/`: `candidates`,
  `tracked`, `track`, `scanners`, `scanner_ranging`, `options`,
  `options/set`, `findmy`, `findmy/add`, `findmy/remove`, `tiles`,
  `tile_identities`, `tile/bind`, `tile/adopt`. All are prefixed
  `sextant/`.
- `GET /api/sextant/selftest` runs the leave-one-out self-test on demand.
