"""What a restart would otherwise throw away.

A cycle carries state that is not in the layout and not in any sensor: each
thing's Kalman filter, its room and spot elections with their smoothed
probabilities and timers, and when it arrived where it is. All of it is
built from the last few minutes of readings, so after a restart every thing
starts cold - rooms have to be re-earned, a spot cannot be held, and a
person follows whichever of their things happens to settle first. The house
did not change while Home Assistant was down; only Sextant's memory of it.

So the state is written to disk and read back if the gap was short. Read
back it is a starting point, never a lock: the elections carry on from
where they were and the next cycle of readings can disagree with them. A
longer gap keeps only when each thing was last heard and where, which is
what the Live page needs to say "away since 5:32 PM" instead of nothing.

Pure: the caller hands in the live dicts and gets plain JSON back.
