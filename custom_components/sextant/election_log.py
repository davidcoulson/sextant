"""An opt-in record of every floor election, for replaying them later.

Each cycle publishes, per thing, the elected floor, the smoothed odds and each
contending floor's own fix, fit, proximity score and the proxies behind it
(``floor_cands``). The panel shows the current cycle and forgets it; a wrong
floor at five in the morning is gone by the time anyone looks. Until now the
only way to keep the cycles was an external subscriber left running overnight
(tools/floor_capture.py).

With ``election_log_hours`` set on the Tuning page, Sextant keeps them itself:
one JSON line per thing per cycle, in hourly files under
``config/sextant_election_log``, dropped once they are older than the window.
tools/replay_floors.py reads the directory and replays the elections under
other settings. About 2.5 MB an hour for thirty things at fifteen-second
cycles; a day is some 60 MB, a week 400, which is why it is off by default.

This module imports nothing from the rest of the package.
