"""Truth marks: "it is actually here", and what to make of that.

A mark is a thing, a floor and a point the user vouches for, taken with
the solver inputs of the cycles around it (the per-proxy radii the fit
used and the thing's vector of ranges). With those inputs kept, the
same cycles can be re-solved under any settings, so a mark answers three
questions:

* which blend of geometric fit and fingerprint match, and which reference
  gain, puts THIS thing nearest the truth (``evaluate`` sweeps them);
* how far off the current settings are, in metres, per thing: an
  accuracy figure the stability KPI cannot give (``evaluate`` with the
  current settings only);
* what this thing's ranges look like at a known point: a fingerprint
  reference where no probe sits (``mark_reference``), in the same probe
  scale the receivers' references use.

Everything here is pure except ``Buffer``, which only holds recent
samples in memory; the solve itself is the caller's (``_solve_floor_jobs``
in __init__), passed in so this module never imports the integration.
