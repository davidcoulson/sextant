"""Fingerprint positioning with the receivers as free reference points.

Every receiver that advertises (an ESPHome iBeacon, a Shelly) is heard by
every other receiver, so Bermuda continuously measures a labelled vector of
ranges at a known position - one per placed receiver, refreshed for free.
A thing's own vector of ranges can be matched against those reference
vectors by similarity, and the thing placed at a weighted average of the
best-matching receivers' positions. Nothing here uses a path-loss model to
turn a range into geometry: a wall that makes receiver X read a thing
long makes X read the reference receivers behind that wall long too, and
the comparison cancels it. That is what ESPresense Companion and
room-assistant lean on, and it is what a dense receiver layout is good at.

The trilateration keeps its job; this module produces a second opinion
(a fix and a per-floor confidence) that __init__ fuses with the geometric
fit according to the ``position_estimator`` tuning. It can also place a
thing that only ONE receiver hears, where trilateration has nothing.

All functions are pure so the match can run in the executor.
