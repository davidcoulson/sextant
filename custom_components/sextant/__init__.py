# --- Stale distance readings (per receiver, per thing) ----------------------
# A distance_to sensor keeps its last value when its scanner stops hearing the
# thing: the reading goes STUCK rather than unavailable (most visible on
# Bermuda's unfiltered distance entities, which have no timeout of their own).
# Fed to the solver, a stuck radius anchors the fix to a receiver that can no
# longer see the device. Readings older than this are dropped from the solve;
# override with a top-level "reading_max_age" (seconds) in the layout, or set it
# to 0 to disable the gate entirely.
#
# Raised from 30. Observed live on a real 48-receiver install (using the
# direct Bermuda API path in bermuda_source.py): "stale, dropped" rejections
# clustered almost entirely at exactly 30-31s old, with no long tail of much
# older readings, and enough of them that at least one thing went unsolved
# for a full 5 minutes and had its position cleared. That tight clustering
# right on the boundary, rather than a spread of ages, points to real per-pair
# advertise cadence (some scanner/device pairs just don't hear each other more
# often than ~30s - common when a BLE thing throttles its advertise rate
# while stationary to save battery) landing on a threshold with almost no
# margin, not to genuinely dead receivers (which would show much larger ages
# and wouldn't cluster this tightly). 45 gives that normal cadence headroom
# while still dropping anything actually stuck.
#
# Not fully isolated from a second, related variable: this gate's `age` now
# comes from Bermuda's own advert timestamp (the true "last heard" time)
# rather than an entity's last_updated, which is a step change in how this
# value is measured even though the intent - age since last heard - is the
# same. Whether that alone explains the clustering, or the real cadence was
# already this marginal and the entity path happened to mask it, was not
# separately isolated (the entity path cannot run concurrently to A/B, since
# the entities are disabled by design). Either way the fix is the same.

# thing is walking and settles more while it is still, and it adapts its gain
# to the estimated uncertainty rather than weighting every past fix equally.
#
# The noise parameters are defined in METRES (and metres/second) and converted
# into each floor's pixel space via the floor scale, so the filter behaves the
# same on maps of any resolution. They are deliberately "trusting": Sextant already
# reads Bermuda's smoothed rssi_distance (20-sample average + velocity gate), so
# the trilateration fixes fed in here are not raw-RSSI noisy. Tune KF_MEAS_NOISE_M
# up for more smoothing, or KF_ACCEL_NOISE_MS2 up for a snappier response.

# transmit power, so one Bermuda ref_power can read consistently long or short
# for a given tag. Sextant can't change Bermuda's config, but an offset of `delta`
# dB on ref_power is exactly a MULTIPLICATIVE scale on every distance from that
# thing: 10 ** (delta / (10 * attenuation)). So a per-thing offset (stored
# in metres-free dB under the top-level "thing_ref_offsets" map) is applied
# here as a distance factor — tunable live from the panel while watching the
# map, and portable back into Bermuda's own ref_power once a value is found.

         Proximity-independent: the probes advertise iBeacons the scanners hear

         this tier can't see it at all — hence the fallbacks below.
      2. A `binary_sensor.<slug>_status` connectivity sensor.
      3. The receiver's HA device: online while any of its entities is not
         `unavailable`; a connectivity entity on the device is authoritative.
      4. Distance heuristic (last resort): working if some thing got a reading

       The lock releases when the point sits more than zone_unlock_margin
       metres outside the locked zone for zone_unlock_secs (the time
       already spent away then counts toward the dwell, so the switch
       follows at once), when the thing is clearly moving again for
       stationary_secs, or when the locked zone has all but lost the
       evidence (under ZONE_OUTVOTED_SHARE of it) for twice
       zone_unlock_secs - a lock is there to hold through jitter, not to
       outlast the thing being somewhere else.

    nearest_zone stays instantaneous for automations that want the raw
    answer, and zone_raw in the API carries the point's own zone. Turning

    known_points are (x, y, r[, w[, wr]]) tuples. The optional w is a per-point
    reliability in [0, 1] (1 = fully trusted); it multiplies the geometric
    1/r^2 weight, so a spiky reading pulls the fit less without being dropped.
    Missing w defaults to 1. The optional wr overrides r as the RADIUS USED IN
    THE GEOMETRIC WEIGHT (the residual always uses r): live callers pass the
    measured slant (px) here, so a height-corrected projection that collapsed
    to the floor cannot buy itself dominant 1/r^2 influence — following the
    4-tuple form with collapsed projected radii reintroduces exactly the 1.7.0
    hijack. min_weight_radius clamps whichever weight radius is in use.

    bounds, when given as (minx, miny, maxx, maxy), constrains the solution to
    the floor's extent: the fit then finds the best position WITHIN the map,
    which lands on the boundary when an unconstrained fit would escape it.

    min_weight_radius clamps the radius used in the 1/r^2 WEIGHT (never the
    residual). Callers pass a physical floor in pixels (MIN_WEIGHT_RADIUS_M x
    floor scale): a near-zero radius — device at the receiver, or a slant range
    fully consumed by a known mount height — is an honest reading, but its
    weight must stay finite or that single receiver decides the whole fit. The
    default keeps the bare no-scale fallback safe against division by zero.

    stable_hint, when given, is an (x, y) the caller already believes is close
    (typically last cycle's own fix) because nothing has moved much since. It
    tries ONE solve from there first instead of the usual multi-start battery;
    only when that fails to converge does it fall back to the full battery
    below, so a hint can only save work, never cost accuracy.
