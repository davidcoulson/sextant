"""
Read Bermuda's per-scanner distances without enabling its entities.

Sextant historically sourced its thing<->receiver distances by enumerating
``sensor.<device>_distance_to_<scanner>`` from the state machine. Bermuda
creates those entities *disabled by default* precisely because there is one per
(tracked device x scanner) pair: on a 60-proxy install that is thousands of
entities, each writing to the recorder and fanning ``state_changed`` out to
every websocket client - to surface data Bermuda already holds in memory.

Bermuda exposes that data directly via ``custom_components.bermuda.api``
(SNAPSHOT_VERSION 1). This module adapts it to the shape Sextant already speaks -
keyed by device prefix and scanner slug that Sextant floorplans are stored
against - so the rest of Sextant is unchanged and existing saved configs keep
working.

Key detail: the device/scanner slug map is resolved from the live snapshot,
not the entity registry. An earlier version of this module read it from the
registry instead, on the theory that Bermuda's frozen, once-assigned
``_distance_to_<slug>`` entity_ids were a more stable join key than a slug
recomputed from the current name. That reasoning stops applying the moment a
user turns off `create_scanner_entities` (Bermuda's own opt-out for exactly
this entity-count cost) - with no entities being created, there is nothing in
the registry to join against, disabled or not, and every registry-based
lookup here silently returned nothing. Reading current slugs directly from
the snapshot is the only join source that actually works in that
configuration, so it is the only one this module uses now.

If Bermuda is missing, too old to have the API, or the snapshot version is
unknown, every helper here returns None and callers fall back to the original
entity-scraping path.
