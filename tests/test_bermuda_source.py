"""Tests for the direct Bermuda data path (sextant.bermuda_source).

Sextant used to source thing<->receiver distances by scraping
``sensor.<device>_distance_to_<scanner>`` out of the state machine, which
forces every one of those entities to be enabled. These cover the replacement
path that reads Bermuda's in-memory snapshot instead, and — importantly — that
Sextant still falls back to entity scraping when Bermuda's API is not available.

Everything here is built from the live snapshot alone. An earlier version of
this module (and these tests) mocked the entity registry too, on the theory
that Bermuda's frozen entity_ids were a more reliable join key than a
recomputed slug. That stopped being true once `create_scanner_entities=False`
became a supported Bermuda configuration: with no entities being created,
there is nothing in the registry to mock meaningfully, and every test that
still faked one would just be exercising code this module no longer has.
